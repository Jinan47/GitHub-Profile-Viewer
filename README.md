# GitHub Profile Viewer

## Purpose
The **GitHub Profile Viewer** is a command-line tool designed to fetch and display detailed information about GitHub user profiles.

## Motivation
This project was built as a learning exercise to understand and practice the use of virtual environments in Python. By creating this tool, I aimed to gain hands-on experience with setting up and managing a Python virtual environment, handling external dependencies, and building a practical application.

## Features
- Fetches GitHub user profile information using the GitHub API.
- Displays user details such as username, name, public repositories count, and more.
